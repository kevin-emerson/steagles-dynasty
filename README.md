# For testing the front end for development

Once your back end tests return data you can test the front end.

Start by taking your auth token and putting it inside the quotes in **useState('')**

With a valid token saved, start your backend and in the front end terminal execute **npm run dev**

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173/user-details** and you will see your teams as they display on steaglesdynastyleague.ca 

If it does not display or returns an error, you may need to refresh your token and try again.
